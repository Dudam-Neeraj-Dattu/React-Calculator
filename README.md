You can clone the repository using ```https://github.com/Dudam-Neeraj-Dattu/React-Calculator.git``` 

In the terminal, give a command ```npm start```

This runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
